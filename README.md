Project Report:

WEEK 1 
We started our project learning with basic python modules-numpy,matplotlib and pandas. These are useful for data extracting and visualizing and analysis.

WEEK 2 
We then studied regression and classification, which are techniques for predicting continuous or discrete data. We trained and tested models using these methods. Regression and classification are widely applicable, such as in predicting stock prices and forecasting outcomes based on input features (independent variables).

WEEK 3 
we explored neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).learnt about LSTM(long short term memory) very useful for predictions . We trained these models on various datasets to make predictions, including tasks like identifying digits in images. time series analysis.

WEEK 4 
We learned about the Librosa module for audio preprocessing, which I found particularly enjoyable. Using Librosa, we could alter the pitch and duration of audio (stretching or compressing time). Additionally, we visualized audio waveforms and spectrograms, and extracted various audio features like zero crosssing rate , mfcc(mei frequency Cepstral Coefficients) which give features(10-20) of signal , spectral centroids.
